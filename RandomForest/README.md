All instructions are given in the jupyter notebook, but to clarify the code:
1)Installs required Python packages: yfinance and pandas_ta.

2)Imports necessary Python libraries, including yfinance, pandas, pandas_ta, os, and matplotlib.pyplot.

3)Downloads financial data for the stock ticker 'ATVI' from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from '2008-03-11' to '2023-07-10'.

4)Creates a "Tomorrow" column and a "Target" column in the financial data. The "Target" column is based on whether the "Tomorrow" price is higher than the "Close" price.

5)Prepares the financial dataset by selecting relevant columns and handling missing data.

6)Defines a function make_predictions for making predictions using a machine learning model.

7)Defines a function custom_backtest for performing a custom backtest using the model.

8)Calculates rolling averages and creates new predictors based on different time horizons.

9)Reads news data from a CSV file named 'checked_news.csv' and processes it to create a dictionary of news sentiment based on dates.

10)Merges the financial data with the news data based on the 'Date' column.

11)Trains a Random Forest Classifier model with specified hyperparameters using the financial data.

12)Performs a custom backtest on the model and calculates the precision score of the predictions.
